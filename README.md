# Tetanus C2

Tetanus is a basic command-and-control platform which aims to support basic expected functionality such as communicating with and sending payload jobs to remote agents. 

Currently, Tetanus is comprised of three crates: tetanus-server `./cnc/`, tetanus-agent `./agent` and tetanus `./common` which contains models and structures used by both the Agent and Server.

## Why?

Tetanus is my first project in Rust and is primarily intended to give me some experience in the language - I am not certain how feature-complete I will make it.
